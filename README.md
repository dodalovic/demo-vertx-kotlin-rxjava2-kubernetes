# Demonstration of Eclipse Vert.x, Kotlin, RxJava2 and Kubernetes

This repository contains several reactive services to be deployed in Kubernetes.

1. [temperature-service](temperature-service) is a service simulating a temperature sensor.
   This is basic Vert.x with callbacks, multiple verticles and communication over the event bus.
   _(Vert.x web, Kotlin support)_
2. [temperature-gateway](temperature-gateway) is a service that aggregates temperature data from the available temperature services.
   RxJava2/Kotlin simplifies the reasoning for doing concurrent HTTP requests.
   _(Vert.x web / web client / service discovery, RxJava2)_
3. [zlack](zlack) is a chat application, exposing an API and a reactive VueJS interface.
   It provides real-time message deliveries and shows how the Vert.x event bus can be extended to client-side applications and offer a unified message-passing programming model.
   _(Vert.x web / web client / SockJS event bus bridge / RxJava 2 / MongoDB / VueJS)_ 
4. [temperature-to-zlack-service](temperature-to-zlack-service) is a service that gathers all temperatures from the gateway, and notifies in the Zlack chat of all sensors having a temperature above a threshold.
   It uses Kotlin coroutines to show how a more traditional _"synchronous-style"_ programming model can be used to coordinate operations.
   _(Vert.x web client / Kotlin coroutines)_

The [kubernetes](kubernetes) folder contains resource descriptors and notes for Kubernetes and `minikube`.

## Building

Building all services should be as simple as:

    ./gradlew assemble

While developing a Vert.x service you can have live-reload, as in:

    ./gradlew :temperature-gateway:vertxRun

# Deploying

_The following assumes a local testing environment with `minikube`._

Building all Docker images and creating Kubernetes resources can then be done using:

    ./deploy-to-kube.sh

...or calling the Gradle task that delegates to this script:

    ./gradlew deployToKube

_If you are not deploying to `minikube`:_

1. all sub-projects have corresponding `Dockerfile` files, and
2. all Kubernetes resource files are in [kubernetes/](kubernetes).
